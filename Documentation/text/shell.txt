ELKS uses the ash or Almquist shell. This is the port for ELKS which was ported 
from the MINIX version in 1998.

This had commented code to include the GNU Readline library or the editline 
library (by Simmule Turner and Rich Salz). 

These libraries provide a set of functions that allow users to edit command 
lines as they are typed in. They also include additional functions to maintain 
a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those 
lines. Both libraries were not used with ELKS, probably because of memory space
requirements.

I now added these functions using the small Linenoise library by Salvatore 
Sanfilippo from Sicily. It is available on GitHub at 
https://github.com/antirez/linenoise . This library was reduced in size and
adapted to ELKS and its ash port.

This library adds the following commands to allow for line editing and command
history:

Cursor-Up
    Search backward in the history.
Cursor-Down
    Search forward in the history.

Cursor-Left / Control-b
    Move back one character. 
Cursor-Right / Control-f
    Move forward one character. 
Backspace
    Delete the character to the left of the cursor. 
DEL 
    Delete the character underneath the cursor.
Printing characters
    Insert the character into the line at the cursor position.
 
Home / Control-a
    Move to the start of the line. 
End / Control-e
    Move to the end of the line. 

Control-u
    Delete entire line
Control-l
    Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top. 
Control-k
    Delete the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.
Control-w
    Delete from the cursor to the previous word.
