			Kilo editor</b></font></font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Kilo
			is is an easy to use command line text editor that is included in
			ELKS. Its interface is comparable to GUI-based text editors, which
			makes it a good choice for those who find </font><code><font face="Arial, sans-serif">vi</font></code>
			<font face="Arial, sans-serif">or </font><code><font face="Arial, sans-serif">emacs</font></code>
			<font face="Arial, sans-serif">commands non-intuitive. </font>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Unlike
			</font><code><font face="Arial, sans-serif">vi</font></code><font face="Arial, sans-serif">,
			there is no need to enter Edit Mode before inputting text; you can
			begin typing as soon as the window opens. The commands supported
			by Kilo</font> <font face="Arial, sans-serif">are displayed on a
			help page which you can open by entering CTRL+a.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The
			default setting is inserting the chararcters at the current cursor
			position and moving the following characters to the right. You can
			set Kilo into replace mode using the Insert key and back into
			insert mode by pressing this key again.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Moving the
			cursor</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
			can use the arrow keys to move the cursor in the text. You can
			select the Home key to move the cursor to the beginning of a line
			and the End key to move the cursor to the end of a line. Using the
			Page up and Page down keys you can scroll through the text. If you
			enter CTRL+t you will move to the top of the file and if you enter
			CTRL+e you will move to the end of the file.</font></font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Use
			the arrow keys to move the cursor. Or use Home and End to set it
			at the beginning or end of the current line. You can also use the
			PageUp or PageDown keys to move through the file.</font> 
			</p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Opening and
			Creating Files </font>
			</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">To
			open an existing file or to create a new file, type kilo followed
			by the file name. This opens a new editor window, and you can
			start editing the file. If you do not supply a file name you have
			to specify the name when you save the file.</font></p>

Syntax
			Highlighting</font></h3>
			<h3 class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Kilo
			supports syntax highlighting for c/cpp, python, go and javascript.
			It selects the highlighting type depending on the file suffix and
			displays the selected highlighting type in the status bar after
			loading the file. If the file type is not recognized or it is a
			text file, the display will be white text on a black background.</font></font></h3>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Search and
			Replace Text</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">To
			search for text in a document, use CTRL+f. This will open a search
			prompt where you can enter the search string. Kilo will jump to
			the first occurence of this string in the file. Use cursor-down to
			jump to the next occurence of this string or use cursor-up to go
			back up in the file to search for the string. If you press enter
			you will leave the search function and the cursor will stay on the
			same line where the string was found. If you press ESC, you will
			return to the location where you started the search.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If
			you press CTRL+r you will be asked if you want to be prompted to
			replace a string found or if you want to replace all occurences in
			the file without asking. You will then be prompted for a string to
			search for and a string to replace this string with. Then Kilo
			will jump to the first occurence of the search string. If you
			press the Home key then, you will replace the string found. If you
			enter cursor-down, you will not replace the string but jump to the
			next occurence. <br/>
If you selected to replace the string in the
			entire file you will not be prompted to decide if you want to
			replace. You can leave the replace function with Enter or ESC.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Bookmarks</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">To
			jump directly to predefined lines in the edited file, you can use
			up to seven bookmarks. If you enter CTRL+b, you can set, select or
			delete bookmarks and view the stored bookmarks. If you enter a
			number between 1 and 7 you can store the current line as a
			bookmark with that number. If a bookmark with that number has been
			stored already, kilo will jump to that line for you. However, if
			that line is the current line now and you selected the number of
			the bootmark used to store that line, the bookmark will be
			deleted. Entering ‘d‘ will clear the screen and show a list of
			the stored bookmarks. You can select one of these to jump to that
			line or delete it.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Copy and Paste</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">When
			you enter CTRL+c Kilo will allow you to select and copy a block of
			characters into a buffer. The current position when you enter
			CTRL+c is the start of the block and you can then use the cursor
			keys to select characters and lines to the right or below the
			start of this block. When you press enter the characters from the
			start of the block up to but not including the current cursor
			position will be copied into the buffer.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">You
			can then move the cursor to a different location in the text and
			insert this block there using CTRL+v. If you load a new file using
			CTRL+o you can paste the copied line(s) into this new file. CTRL+x
			will delete the current line and also copy it into the buffer so
			you can paste it into the text at any position using CTRL+v.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">You
			can write the contents of the copy buffer to the file
			kilobuffer.txt using CTRL+p. You can use CTLR+L later to insert
			this file anywhere into your current file.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Insert file</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If
			you want to insert a file from disk into the file you are
			currently editing, enter CTRL+L and Kilo will ask you for the name
			of the desired file. Then it will insert the lines of that file at
			the current cursor position.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Undo</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Kilo
			has a very simple undo feature. When you enter a space character,
			a Tab or press the Enter key in the edited text, Kilo will mark
			this as a beginning of an undo block. You can use CTRL+z then to
			erase the text from the current cursor position to the beginning
			of the block, e.g. the last space chararcter. Kilo willl not erase
			a newline that it inserted after an Enter key, it will just erase
			entered characters. </font>
			</p>
			<h3 class="western"><a name="save"></a><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Save</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">To
			save your work, use CTRL+s. This will save the document and leave
			kilo running for you to continue editing.<br/>
You can also use
			CTRL+w to save the file with a different name.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Open</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">You
			can load a new file when you enter CTRL+o. You will be asked
			whether to save your edited file to avoid discarding the
			modifications you made in the loaded file.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">New</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">When
			you enter CTRL+n Kilo will remove the edited file and allow you to
			type in a new file from scratch. You will be asked to save your
			currently edited file to avoid discarding the modifications you
			made. If you copied a block of characters into the internal buffer
			using CTRL+c, you can use CTRL+v to enter these into the new file.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">List of
			recently opened files</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">When
			you press CTRL+j Kilo will display a list of the files you opened
			recently. Kilo has saved this list on disk in the file
			“.kilorecent“. You will be asked to select a file from the
			list. Kilo will then save the currently edited file and load the
			selected file. It has stored the cursor position when you last
			used this file and will put the cursor at that position. This way
			you can switch quickly between several files just as if these were
			opened in subwindows. Using cut and paste you can copy characters
			from one file to the other.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><img src="../../img/kilo-help-page.png" name="Bild2" align="left" width="643" height="396" border="0"/>
<font face="Arial, sans-serif">Help</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If
			you enter CTRL+a, kilo will clear the screen and display a help
			page. If you press any key kilo will display the edited text again
			and execute the entered key. You can select a CTRL key from the
			list to execute that, e.g. CTRL+w to save the file under a
			different name. But if you want no change, just enter CTRL+a again
			to clear the help page.</font></p>
			<h3 class="western"><a name="exit"></a><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Exit</font></h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Use
			CTRL+q to exit kilo. If you have not saved your work, you will be
			prompted to enter ‘y‘ to discard your modifications.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">A
			screencast demonstrating Kilo is available here:

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Kilo
			does not depend on any library (not even curses). It uses fairly

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Greg
			Haerr ported Kilo to ELKS. Here is a link to <a href="https://github.com/jbruchon/elks/pull/554">his
			original commit</a>. It describes the changes that were required
			to get Kilo to run with ELKS.<br/>
<br/>
I looked through the
			uncommitted pull requests and issues raised on the Kilo site on
			GitHub and extended Kilo based on that. Debugged and rewrote
			several pull requests in the process. Then I added quite a number
			of additional features to Kilo.</font></p>
